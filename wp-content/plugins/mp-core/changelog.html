<strong>1.0.2.0 = May 13, 2015</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Revert Change in 1.0.1.9 of mp_core_get_post_meta back to the way it was in 1.0.1.8.</li>
</ul>
<strong>1.0.1.9 = May 13, 2015</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Use esc_url_raw instead of mp_core_add_query_arg for plugin checker/installer</li>
    <li>Better message if "allow_url_fopen" isn't "on" in class-plugin-installer.php. Lets user know what action to take.</li>
    <li>Hover animations are now disabled for touch devices because hovering isn't a thing on touch devices. Previously, if the user clicked once, the animation fired. This proved to be frustrating for mobile users so the action is now disabled entirely to reduce clicks.</li>
    <li>Change: mp_core_get_post_meta now only returns the "default" setting if its value has never been saved before. This way, if the user desires to have a "blank" value saved, they can. Previously, if the value was blank, it would return the default value no matter what.</li>
    <li>Fix: Preserve keys in mp_core_insert_meta. When inserting a meta option using mp_core_insert_meta, the meta key was removed. If you wanted to then insert more meta options later in the page, you couldn't because the keys were removed and replaced with array numbers eg array[0] instead of array['mykey'].</li>
</ul>

<strong>1.0.1.2 = March 24, 2015</strong>
<ul>
    <li>TinyMCE Fix: Only re-initialize TinyMCE after Repeaters duplicated or re-ordered if it was previously set to be in “Visual” mode. Otherwise don’t reinitialize. This fixes the issue of having multiple text areas in one area upon repeater changes.</li>
    <li>Removed "Please Wait" from "Installing Items" in plugin installer.</li>

    <li>Change “Install Items” > “Installing Required Items” in the plugin checker.</li>
    <li>Make checkboxes in repeaters save an empty value (before they were removed from the repeater array if unchecked). This way we can check if the field key exists to know whether it has ever been saved before.</li>
    <li>Added function called “mp_core_get_post_meta_checkbox” which allows us to set a default for checkboxes when retrieving them.</li>
    <li>Animation upgrades for background color</li>
