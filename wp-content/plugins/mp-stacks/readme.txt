An amazing Page Builder for WordPress. Content-Types go in a Brick, Bricks go in a Stack, Stacks go on a page.

== Description ==

Build pages using the MP Stacks plugin by making "Bricks". Each Brick can have its own background image, colour, size, and 2 "Content-Types". 

There are 3 Content-Types built into the MP Stacks Plugin: Video, Image, and Text.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Upload the 'mp-stacks' folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. On any page or post, click the "Add Stack" button, save, and view the page/post.
4. Add Bricks into the "Stack" by clicking "Add a Brick to this Stack" when viewing the page or post.

= 1.0.2.3 = April 5, 2015
* Added HTML note about inline JS
* Fixed Bug with some WordPress installations not firing the '99' function priority for 'save_post'. This was causing Bricks to not be placed into Stacks upon creation. Now the mp_stacks_order function that fires upon 'save_post' fires at priority 11 instead of 99.

= 1.0.2.2 = April 3, 2015
* Added lightbox.js as dependancy for admin.js enqueue
* Added default height of 250px for "no brick" brick.

* Bug Fix: Empty Stacks Weren't Adding Bricks.

= 1.0.2.0 = March 26, 2015
* Brick ordering bug fix: Remove menu_order from all Brick WP Queries. This forces it to use meta_value_num and mp_stacks_oder{stack_id} so the order won't get changed when it shouldn't.

= 1.0.1.9 = March 24, 2015
* TinyMCE Fix: Only re-initialize TinyMCE after Content-Type Reorders if it was previously set to be in “Visual” mode. Otherwise don’t reinitialize. This fixes the issue of having multiple text areas in one area upon re-ordering.
* Better styling for wp admin footer in minimal mode
* vertical-align grid items to "top" in front end css.
* Only show the "Edit this Stack's Bricks" if developer
* Added tip for video popup size to image link
* Add the Slug of a brick to the Brick Editor Footer
* Right Side-Items in Brick Editor are now “closed” by default.
* Updated plugin checker to version in mp_core 1.0.1.2
* Changed priority of MP Stacks front end Enqueue to 1 so it's styles are output before other styles (was a lag on some machines where MP Stacks styles 'kicked-in' after load).
* Added bg inner div  which now holds the brick backgrounds
* Bricks-In-Stack list added to TinyMCE "Link" creator
* Brick Auto Scroll is now 100ms instead of 500ms
* Added CSS ID Selectors to Content Types and their container divs
* Added inline_js output in wp_footer
* Upon new Brick added to Stack, we loop through all Bricks in the Stack and order them starting at 1000 and going up by 10 each time. This fixes a bug where Stacks randomly had Bricks out of order.

= 1.0.1.8 = March 1, 2015
* Added versions to all enqueues
* mp_core_post_submitted Jquery Trigger Added.
* Grid Background CSS Added

* CSS Vertical Alignment change for first/second content type areas to “bottom” instead of “baseline”.
* Removed Mobile text size check. It’s too much of a hog for mobile devices.

= 1.0.1.7 = February 4, 2015
* Default Stacks for Theme Bundles: Use the Stack Title in the template for defaults.
* Add Stack Description to Stack Template code if developer add-on is active.

= 1.0.1.6 = February 3, 2015
* Fixed bug with lightbox popups where they wouldn’t open because of the alternate URL.

= 1.0.1.5 = February 1, 2015
* Fix for text areas when re-ordering contentTypes. TinyMce’s weren’t being re-set right when Content-Types were re-ordered.
* New option for Space Below: This allows the user to change the margin below the content-type area independently from the top (above) margin. Prevously, above and below had to match

* Apply default of 20px below 1st content type on mobile sizes (<600px)

* Improved Button Styling inside text areas so they don’t bump into each other on mobile.
* Fixed bug where, on some WP installs bricks weren’t getting added to Stacks because a priority was assigned to the save_post function - the priority was 100 - but 100 wasn’t firing at all on Brick saves. This fixes that.
* Better Masonry Handling for Grids
* Main Image Lightbox has moved from an Add-On to MP Stacks core.
* Made Image links css default to 100% width (only images without a link were doing this - although for most scenarios it isn’t an issue because of the max-width setting).

* When duplicating a stack, you now have the option to preview the stack you are duplicating.
* Added some error checking when making a new stack via the stack template function.

= 1.0.1.3 = December 1, 2014
* Fixed:  Other taxonomies' "edit" buttons weren't returned and so, were not linking to anything.
* First and Second Content Type divs set to inline-block so they wrap around content no matter what.
