<strong>1.0.1.9 = March 24, 2015</strong>
<ul>
    <li>TinyMCE Fix: Only re-initialize TinyMCE after Content-Type Reorders if it was previously set to be in “Visual” mode. Otherwise don’t reinitialize. This fixes the issue of having multiple text areas in one area upon re-ordering.</li>

</ul>
<strong>1.0.1.5 = February 1, 2015</strong>
	<ul>
    	<li>Fix for text areas when re-ordering contentTypes. TinyMce’s weren’t being re-set right when Content-Types were re-ordered.</li>
        <li>New option for Space Below: This allows the user to change the margin below the content-type area independently from the top (above) margin. Prevously, above and below had to match</li>
        <li>Moved Minimum height Meta option under the “Margin” showhider.</li>
        <li>Removed “Minimum” from space above/below option descriptions.</li>

        <li>Fixed bug where, on some WP installs bricks weren’t getting added to Stacks because a priority was assigned to the save_post function - the priority was 100 - but 100 wasn’t firing at all on Brick saves. This fixes that.</li>
        <li>Better Masonry Handling for Grids</li>
        <li>Main Image Lightbox has moved from an Add-On to MP Stacks core.</li>
        <li>Made Image links css default to 100% width (only images without a link were doing this - although for most scenarios it isn’t an issue because of the max-width setting).</li>
        <li>For Lightboxes, added ability for alternate URL</li>
        <li>CSS Vertical Alignment change for img types to “baseline” instead of “text-bottom”.</li>
